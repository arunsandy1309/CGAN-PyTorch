This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the following paper:

>**Abstract:** _In this work we introduce the conditional version of generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the data, y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. We show that this model can generate images conditioned on class labels. We also illustrate how this model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and provide preliminary examples of an application to image tagging in which we demonstrate how this approach can generate descriptive tags which are not part of training labels._

## Architecture

Both generator and discriminator are fed a class label y and conditioned on it, as shown in the above figures. All other components are exactly what you see in a typical  Generative Adversarial Networks framework, this being more of an architectural modification. 

## Usage
First, download the Hand gestures dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors)
+ Create folders 'data' and 'results'
+ Place the folders downloaded from Kaggle in the 'data' folder.
+ Run the Python file
+ For every 100<sup>th</sup> iteration in every Epoch, the fake image generated by the Generator will be saved in the 'results' folder. In total, we have 200 fake images.

## Results
| After 10<sup>th</sup> Epoch:</br> | After 50<sup>th</sup> Epoch:</br> |
